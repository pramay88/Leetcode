100363. Minimum Number of Seconds to Make Mountain Height Zero

Difficulty:Medium
You are given an integer mountainHeight denoting the height of a mountain.

You are also given an integer array workerTimes representing the work time of workers in seconds.

The workers work simultaneously to reduce the height of the mountain. For worker i:

To decrease the mountain's height by x, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x seconds. For example:
To reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes workerTimes[i] seconds.
To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 seconds, and so on.
Return an integer representing the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.

Example 1:

Input: mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1]

Output: 3

Explanation:

One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is:

Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[0] = 2 seconds.
Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3 seconds.
Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[2] = 1 second.
Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is max(2, 3, 1) = 3 seconds.

Example 2:

Input: mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4]

Output: 12

Explanation:

Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9 seconds.
Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12 seconds.
Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12 seconds.
Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12 seconds.
The number of seconds needed is max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12 seconds.

Example 3:

Input: mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1]

Output: 15

Explanation:

There is only one worker in this example, so the answer is workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 + workerTimes[0] * 5 = 15.

 

Constraints:

1 <= mountainHeight <= 105
1 <= workerTimes.length <= 104
1 <= workerTimes[i] <= 106

CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    
    bool canReduceHeight(int mountainHeight, const vector<int>& workerTimes, long long totalTime) {
    long long totalReduced = 0;

    for (int time : workerTimes) {
        long long left = 0, right = mountainHeight; 
        while (left < right) {
            long long mid = left + (right - left + 1) / 2;
            long long cost = time * (mid * (mid + 1)) / 2; 

            if (cost <= totalTime) {
                left = mid; 
            } else {
                right = mid - 1; 
            }
        }
        totalReduced += left; 
    }

    return totalReduced >= mountainHeight; 
}

long long minNumberOfSeconds(int mountainHeight, const vector<int>& workerTimes) {
    long long low = 0, high = 1e18;

    while (low < high) {
        long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

        if (canReduceHeight(mountainHeight, workerTimes, mid)) {
            high = mid; 
        } else {
            low = mid + 1; 
        }
    }

    return low; 
}
};
